# Garden-Helper
Plant status monitor that uses capacitive touch technology. Never worry about the health of your plant again.

The Garden Helper is a lightweight device that, when inserted into the soil of a potted plant, will provide information about the soil moisture level. The input is the user’s touch on any part of the plant. The output is one of two sounds: a calming, peaceful sound signifying that the plant does not need to be watered, and a harsh, distorted sound indicating that it does need to be watered. The input also works as a toggle, meaning the user touches the plant once to activate the sound and again to deactivate the sound.

This device aims to eliminate any digital GUI when growing potted plants. It is meant to be a tool that verifies when plants need to be watered through physical touch and auditory response. Since the input is physically touching the plant and the digital part is hidden, this is a tangible user interface. The purpose of this device is to create a more meaningful connection between people and their plants and to provide the necessary information for caring for plants solely through touch. This device will help to facilitate the creative process of gardening (specifically, indoor potted plants) and interior design.


Our device provides alternative inputs and outputs for caring for plants. Traditionally, the user would view the plant, see that it is wilted or drooping, and conclude that it needs water. Our alternative is that the user can touch the plant as input, and get an instantaneous and accurate response through sounds.
